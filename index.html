          It has so much gymnastics equipment. At first if you wanted to go to the gymnastics room you had to go at the carpark but now they made a new one which is located near the lift lobby of level 3.
          This gymnastics room is so big it can hold more than 2 classes with 25 students in each class. The equipment is very high tech. In this gymnastics room they have more than 2 places for vaulting and jumping.
          There is also and extra gymnastics room connected to this one in which you can do parkour. The room in which you can do parkour connects you to another gymnastics area in which there is a gymnastics obstacle course which is extremly fun.
